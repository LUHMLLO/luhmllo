_What if you could do something amazing with no setup?_

That's where Lilycat comes in. By focusing on developers as their main users instead of their clients, let's face it, your clients don't care. Most of the time, they have no idea what tech stack you are using or how the newest quantum JS framework will revolutionize the internet. However, your clients, stakeholders, and product owners care about one thing: having their requests delivered. They want their product to work and their problems to be solved. As developers and designers, we often forget that most of the things we create end up in the hands of consumers who know no more than what the product will do for them. Even when given an army knife, they will most likely just use one function. Regardless, we artists want to create masterpiecesâ€”creations with meaning and purposeâ€”and craft something that other artists can find inspiration in and congratulate our efforts, discoveries, and creativity. This is what made Lilycat.

This library is essentially an opinionated reset and normalizer with enough data
attributes to help you focus on making your idea a reality. It can help you
translate designs into code or simply remove stress from the never-ending
evolution of modern front-end development.

Lilycat implements a simple set of CSS variables that allow you to configure
certain aspects to your liking and needs. This ensures that it can adapt to
every type of modern front-end project, including websites, web apps, and
mobile-first web products.

By embracing modern CSS features like variables and layers, as well as the "if
it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality, and accepting that data attributes are
meant to be used, it offers a lightweight, scalable foundation that makes
extending your UI painless. There's no bloated syntax or framework lock-in; just
clean, real CSS and the freedom to build your way.

All of this is possible without blocking users from using other utility-first
CSS libraries, such as Tailwind. You can opt out of everything and use only the
data attributes if you want. But why miss out on the full experience?

## Mission

Lilycat was created to simplify front-end development. Great user interfaces don't require bloated frameworks, endless classes, or an abundance of third parties.

Why fall into the trap of using endless third-party solutions that require as much maintenance as the end product itself when most things can be done with native solutions like HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS (TS for my modern-day developers)?

Lilycat's focus is on tapping into the full power of modern CSS's core tools and appropriate practices, such as variables, layers, cascade controls, attributes, and scoping.

---

## Why Lilycat?

- **HTML should be clean.**  
  Debugging becomes a nightmare when utility classes flood every element.

- **CSS should be a skill, not a chore.**  
  CSS is a powerful tool; avoiding it shouldn't be the goal.

- **Utility-first should assist, not replace.**  
  Although utility classes are great tools, they are not a replacement for solid CSS fundamentals.

- **Separation of concerns matters.**  
  Styles should not be tangled endlessly into your HTML.

---

Although componentization has become the norm nowadays, it has also become dependent on ever-changing solutions, such as front-end frameworks. But did you know that you can do componentization without a framework?

---

## Lilycat + Utility Classes

Lilycat is **not** meant to replace Tailwind or other utility-first frameworks.  
In fact, **you can use Tailwind classes alongside Lilycat if you wish.**

While Lilycat encourages cleaner, less polluted HTML, it **does not oppose** utility classes nor inline styling.

However utility-first should be **an assistant, not a crutch.**  
Youâ€™re free to mix and match â€” we trust developers and designers to decide what fits best for each of their needs.

---

## Benefits

- Lightweight and efficient â€” no unnecessary bloat.
- Native HTML and semantic-first approach.
- Cross-browser consistency out of the box.
- Encourages modern, maintainable, scalable styling practices with an order and clear directives and conventions.

## Who is Lilycat for?

Lilycat is built for:

- CSS evangelist
- Frontend Artisans and Engineers
- Whoever Prefers clean, maintainable HTML.
- Those who believe on native CSS and want to use it to its fullest.
- Value fast iteration without sacrificing long-term code quality.
- Want a system that **helps** â€” not one that **takes over.**

If you're tired of heavy frameworks, bloated utility classes and jumping into the never ending world of abstraction by avoiding to understand the fundamentals of web dev and frontend development... welcome home.
