## Definition list <small> native </small>

`<dl/>` in web development are used to group terms and their
corresponding descriptions. The `<dl/>` element contains pairs of `<dt/>`
(definition term) and `<dd/>` (definition description) elements, making it
ideal for displaying lists of terms and their definitions, such as glossaries
or metadata.

## Ordered list <small> native </small>

`<ol/>` in web development are used to create lists of items that
are presented in a specific order. The `<ol/>` element contains `<li/>` (list item)
elements, which are automatically numbered. Ordered lists are ideal for
displaying steps in a process, rankings, or any content where order is
significant.

## Unordered list <small> native </small>

`<ul/>` in web development are used to create lists of items that
do not require a specific order. The `<ul/>` element contains `<li/>` (list item)
elements, which are typically rendered with bullet points. Unordered lists
are ideal for presenting collections of related items where sequence is not
important.
