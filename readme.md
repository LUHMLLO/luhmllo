# LUHMLLO

Personal site and projects.

## What's here

Site built with stuff I've been working on:

- SvelteKit
- Lilycat (CSS library I made)
- Zimba (TypeScript utilities I use across projects)
- Deno

## The libraries

**Lilycat** and **Zimba** started as side projects to figure out how things work. Built them out of curiosity, kept using them because they're useful.

Lilycat is minimal CSS that gets out of the way. Zimba is TypeScript utilities for common UI patterns - draggable elements, mouse followers, dropdowns. Nothing fancy, just tools that work.

Check them out on JSR:

- [Zimba on JSR](https://jsr.io/@luhmllo/zimba)

## Running it locally

```bash
# add your actual setup commands here
npm install
npm run dev
```

## About

Building tools to understand how they work. If they're useful to others, cool.
