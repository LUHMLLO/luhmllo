# LUHMLLO

Building tools to understand how they work. If they're useful to others, even better.

## The libraries

**Lilycat** and **Zimba** started as side projects to figure out how things work. Built them out of curiosity, kept using them because they're useful.

Lilycat is minimal CSS that gets out of the way. Zimba is TypeScript utilities for common UI patterns - draggable elements, mouse followers, dropdowns. Nothing fancy, just tools that work.
